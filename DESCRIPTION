Title: eSVD2 for performing the eSVD-DE for cohort-wide differential expression analysis
Version: 1.0.1.02
Authors@R: person("Kevin Z", "Lin", email = "kzlin@uw.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package is for the eSVD-DE, a way to test for differential 
    expression for single-cell RNA-seq data when many donors/individuals are 
    sequenced, and you wish to test for differential expression at the 
    individual-level (i.e., among individuals), not at cell-level. 
    Specifically, this method uses the eSVD matrix factorization to pool 
    information among genes together, and then carefully adjusts the denoised 
    gene expression to not inflate the Type-1 error. The eSVD matrix 
    factorization (which is the backbone of the eSVD-DE method) assumes that 
    each row and column of a matrix is associated with a low-dimensional 
    vector, and eSVD estimates an embedding for each cell with respect to a 
    hierarchical model where the inner product between the row's and column's 
    latent vectors is the natural parameter of a one-parameter exponential 
    family random variable.
